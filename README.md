# mCherry_bulk_RNAseqdata

2 mm spinal cord segments were collected from the lesion periphery at 7 dpi, corresponding to the peak of p16-mCherry expression. 
These segments were processed into single-cell suspensions, and mCherry-positive and live mCherry-negative populations were sorted for each animal. 
Total RNA was then extracted and subjected to bulk RNA sequencing. 
Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed between the two populations.
